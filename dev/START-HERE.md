# Start here: Dev workspace

Blocked until both exist in `../shared/`:
- `../shared/design/` (the design system and per-page design specs from Design)
- `../shared/page-briefs/` (the SEO work orders)

If either is missing, the upstream handoff is not ready. Stop and tell the user.

When unblocked:
1. Read `prompts/dev.md`.
2. Build the design system foundation (tokens, base components, motion policy), then each page per its design spec and SEO work order.
3. Keep the code clean and commented: no dead code, no unused imports, small focused components, comment the why.
4. Output the build to `dev/`, and write `../shared/build-report.md`.
